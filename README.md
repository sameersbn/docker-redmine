# Introduction

Dockerfile to build a [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) container image.

## Version

Current Version: **3.0.3-1**

*P.S.: If your installation depends on various third party plugins, please stick with 2.6.xx series to avoid breakage.*

# Contributing

If you find this image useful here's how you can help:

- Send a Pull Request with your awesome new features and bug fixes
- Help new users with [Issues](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-redmine/issues) they may encounter
- Send me a tip via [Bitcoin](https://www.coinbase.com/sameersbn) or using [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/sameersbn/)

# Issues

Docker is a relatively new project and is active being developed and tested by a thriving community of developers and testers and every release of docker features many enhancements and bugfixes.

Given the nature of the development and release cycle it is very important that you have the latest version of docker installed because any issue that you encounter might have already been fixed with a newer docker release.

For ubuntu users I suggest [installing docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/) using docker's own package repository since the version of docker packaged in the ubuntu repositories are a little dated.

Here is the shortform of the installation of an updated version of docker on ubuntu.

```bash
sudo apt-get purge docker.io
curl -s https://get.docker.io/ubuntu/ | sudo sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lxc-docker
```

Fedora and RHEL/CentOS users should try disabling selinux with `setenforce 0` and check if resolves the issue. If it does than there is not much that I can help you with. You can either stick with selinux disabled (not recommended by redhat) or switch to using ubuntu.

If using the latest docker version and/or disabling selinux does not fix the issue then please file a issue request on the [issues](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-redmine/issues) page.

In your issue report please make sure you provide the following information:

- The host distribution and release version.
- Output of the `docker version` command.
- Output of the `docker info` command.
- The `docker run` command you used to run the image (mask out the sensitive bits).

# Installation

Pull the image from the docker index. This is the recommended method of installation as it is easier to update image in the future. These builds are performed by the Trusted Build service.

```bash
docker pull sameersbn/redmine:latest
```

Since version `2.4.2`, the image builds are being tagged. You can now pull a particular version of redmine by specifying the version number. For example,

```bash
docker pull sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

Alternately you can build the image yourself.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-redmine.git
cd docker-redmine
docker build --tag="$USER/redmine" .
```

# Quick Start

The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sameersbn/docker-redmine/master/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

Alternately, you can manually launch the `redmine` container and the supporting `postgresql` container by following this two step guide.

Step 1. Launch a postgresql container

```bash
docker run --name=postgresql-redmine -d \
  --env='DB_NAME=redmine_production' \
  --env='DB_USER=redmine' --env='DB_PASS=password' \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql \
  sameersbn/postgresql:9.4
```

Step 2. Launch the redmine container

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -d \
  --link=postgresql-redmine:postgresql --publish=10083:80 \
  --env='REDMINE_PORT=10083' \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

**NOTE**: Please allow a minute or two for the Redmine application to start.

Point your browser to `http://localhost:10083` and login using the default username and password:

* username: **admin**
* password: **admin**

Make sure you visit the `Administration` link and `Load the default configuration` before creating any projects.

You now have the Redmine application up and ready for testing. If you want to use this image in production the please read on.

*The rest of the document will use the docker command line. You can quite simply adapt your configuration into a `docker-compose.yml` file if you wish to do so.*

# Configuration

## Data Store

For the file storage we need to mount a volume at the following location.

* `/home/redmine/data`

> **NOTE**
>
> Existing users **need to move** the existing files directory inside `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/`.
>
> ```bash
> mkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/redmine
> mv /opt/redmine/files /srv/docker/redmine/redmine
> ```

SELinux users are also required to change the security context of the mount point so that it plays nicely with selinux.

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/redmine
sudo chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /srv/docker/redmine/redmine
```

Volumes can be mounted in docker by specifying the **'-v'** option in the docker run command.

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -it --rm \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

## Database

Redmine uses a database backend to store its data.

### MySQL

#### Internal MySQL Server

The internal mysql server has been removed from the image. Please use a linked [mysql](#linking-to-mysql-container) or [postgresql](#linking-to-postgresql-container) container instead or connect with an external [mysql](#external-mysql-server) or [postgresql](#external-postgresql-server) server.

If you have been using the internal mysql server follow these instructions to migrate to a linked mysql container:

Assuming that your mysql data is available at `/srv/docker/redmine/mysql`

```bash
docker run --name=mysql-redmine -d \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/mysql:/var/lib/mysql \
  sameersbn/mysql:latest
```

This will start a mysql container with your existing mysql data. Now login to the mysql container and create a user for the existing `redmine_production` database.

All you need to do now is link this mysql container to the redmine container using the `--link=mysql-redmine:mysql` option and provide the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASS` parameters.

Refer to [Linking to MySQL Container](#linking-to-mysql-container) for more information.

#### External MySQL Server

The image can be configured to use an external MySQL database instead of starting a MySQL server internally. The database configuration should be specified using environment variables while starting the Redmine image.

Before you start the Redmine image create user and database for redmine.

```sql
mysql -uroot -p
CREATE USER 'redmine'@'%.%.%.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `redmine_production` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET `utf8` COLLATE `utf8_unicode_ci`;
GRANT SELECT, LOCK TABLES, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER ON `redmine_production`.* TO 'redmine'@'%.%.%.%';
```

We are now ready to start the redmine application.

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -it --rm \
  --env='DB_HOST=192.168.1.100' --env='DB_NAME=redmine_production' \
  --env='DB_USER=redmine' --env='DB_PASS=password' \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

This will initialize the redmine database and after a couple of minutes your redmine instance should be ready to use.

#### Linking to MySQL Container

You can link this image with a mysql container for the database requirements. The alias of the mysql server container should be set to **mysql** while linking with the redmine image.

If a mysql container is linked, only the `DB_TYPE`, `DB_HOST` and `DB_PORT` settings are automatically retrieved using the linkage. You may still need to set other database connection parameters such as the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS` and so on.

To illustrate linking with a mysql container, we will use the [sameersbn/mysql](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-mysql) image. When using docker-mysql in production you should mount a volume for the mysql data store. Please refer the [README](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-mysql/blob/master/README.md) of docker-mysql for details.

First, lets pull the mysql image from the docker index.

```bash
docker pull sameersbn/mysql:latest
```

For data persistence lets create a store for the mysql and start the container.

SELinux users are also required to change the security context of the mount point so that it plays nicely with selinux.

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/mysql
sudo chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /srv/docker/redmine/mysql
```

The run command looks like this.

```bash
docker run --name=mysql-redmine -d \
  --env='DB_NAME=redmine_production' \
  --env='DB_USER=redmine' --env='DB_PASS=password' \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/mysql:/var/lib/mysql \
  sameersbn/mysql:latest
```

The above command will create a database named `redmine_production` and also create a user named `redmine` with the password `password` with full/remote access to the `redmine_production` database.

We are now ready to start the redmine application.

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -it --rm --link=mysql-redmine:mysql \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

Here the image will also automatically fetch the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASS` variables from the mysql container as they are specified in the `docker run` command for the mysql container. This is made possible using the magic of docker links and works with the following images:

 - [mysql](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mysql/)
 - [sameersbn/mysql](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sameersbn/mysql/)
 - [centurylink/mysql](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/centurylink/mysql/)
 - [orchardup/mysql](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/orchardup/mysql/)

### PostgreSQL

#### External PostgreSQL Server

The image also supports using an external PostgreSQL Server. This is also controlled via environment variables.

```sql
CREATE ROLE redmine with LOGIN CREATEDB PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE DATABASE redmine_production;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE redmine_production to redmine;
```

We are now ready to start the redmine application.

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -it --rm \
  --env='DB_TYPE=postgres' \
  --env='DB_HOST=192.168.1.100' --env='DB_NAME=redmine_production' \
  --env='DB_USER=redmine' --env='DB_PASS=password' \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

This will initialize the redmine database and after a couple of minutes your redmine instance should be ready to use.

#### Linking to PostgreSQL Container

You can link this image with a postgresql container for the database requirements. The alias of the postgresql server container should be set to **postgresql** while linking with the redmine image.

If a postgresql container is linked, only the `DB_TYPE`, `DB_HOST` and `DB_PORT` settings are automatically retrieved using the linkage. You may still need to set other database connection parameters such as the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS` and so on.

To illustrate linking with a postgresql container, we will use the [sameersbn/postgresql](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-postgresql) image. When using postgresql image in production you should mount a volume for the postgresql data store. Please refer the [README](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-postgresql/blob/master/README.md) of docker-postgresql for details.

First, lets pull the postgresql image from the docker index.

```bash
docker pull sameersbn/postgresql:9.4
```

For data persistence lets create a store for the postgresql and start the container.

SELinux users are also required to change the security context of the mount point so that it plays nicely with selinux.

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/postgresql
sudo chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /srv/docker/redmine/postgresql
```

The run command looks like this.

```bash
docker run --name=postgresql-redmine -d \
  --env='DB_NAME=redmine_production' \
  --env='DB_USER=redmine' --env='DB_PASS=password' \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql \
  sameersbn/postgresql:9.4
```

The above command will create a database named `redmine_production` and also create a user named `redmine` with the password `password` with access to the `redmine_production` database.

We are now ready to start the redmine application.

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -it --rm --link=postgresql-redmine:postgresql \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

Here the image will also automatically fetch the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASS` variables from the postgresql container as they are specified in the `docker run` command for the postgresql container. This is made possible using the magic of docker links and works with the following images:

 - [postgres](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/)
 - [sameersbn/postgresql](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sameersbn/postgresql/)
 - [orchardup/postgresql](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/orchardup/postgresql/)
 - [paintedfox/postgresql](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/paintedfox/postgresql/)

## Memcached (Optional)

This image can (optionally) be configured to use a memcached server to speed up Redmine. This is particularly useful when you have a large number users.

### External Memcached Server

The image can be configured to use an external memcached server. The memcached server host and port configuration should be specified using environment variables `MEMCACHE_HOST` and `MEMCACHE_PORT` like so:

*Assuming that the memcached server host is 192.168.1.100*

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -it --rm \
  --env='MEMCACHE_HOST=192.168.1.100' --env='MEMCACHE_PORT=11211' \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

### Linking to Memcached Container

Alternately you can link this image with a memcached container. The alias of the memcached server container should be set to **memcached** while linking with the redmine image.

To illustrate linking with a memcached container, we will use the [sameersbn/memcached](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-memcached) image. Please refer the [README](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-memcached/blob/master/README.md) of docker-memcached for details.

First, lets pull and launch the memcached image from the docker index.

```bash
docker run --name=memcached-redmine -d sameersbn/memcached:latest
```

Now you can link memcached to the redmine image:

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -it --rm --link=memcached-redmine:memcached \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

### Mail

The mail configuration should be specified using environment variables while starting the redmine image. The configuration defaults to using gmail to send emails and requires the specification of a valid username and password to login to the gmail servers.

Please refer the [Available Configuration Parameters](#available-configuration-parameters) section for the list of SMTP parameters that can be specified.

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -it --rm \
  --env='SMTP_USER=USER@gmail.com' --env='SMTP_PASS=PASSWORD' \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

If you are not using google mail, then please configure the SMTP host and port using the `SMTP_HOST` and `SMTP_PORT` configuration parameters.

__NOTE:__

I have only tested standard gmail and google apps login. I expect that the currently provided configuration parameters should be sufficient for most users. If this is not the case, then please let me know.

### SSL

Access to the redmine application can be secured using SSL so as to prevent unauthorized access. While a CA certified SSL certificate allows for verification of trust via the CA, a self signed certificates can also provide an equal level of trust verification as long as each client takes some additional steps to verify the identity of your website. I will provide instructions on achieving this towards the end of this section.

To secure your application via SSL you basically need two things:
- **Private key (.key)**
- **SSL certificate (.crt)**

When using CA certified certificates, these files are provided to you by the CA. When using self-signed certificates you need to generate these files yourself. Skip the following section if you are armed with CA certified SSL certificates.

Jump to the [Using HTTPS with a load balancer](#using-https-with-a-load-balancer) section if you are using a load balancer such as hipache, haproxy or nginx.

#### Generation of Self Signed Certificates

Generation of self-signed SSL certificates involves a simple 3 step procedure.

**STEP 1**: Create the server private key

```bash
openssl genrsa -out redmine.key 2048
```

**STEP 2**: Create the certificate signing request (CSR)

```bash
openssl req -new -key redmine.key -out redmine.csr
```

**STEP 3**: Sign the certificate using the private key and CSR

```bash
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in redmine.csr -signkey redmine.key -out redmine.crt
```

Congratulations! you have now generated an SSL certificate thats valid for 365 days.

#### Strengthening the server security

This section provides you with instructions to [strengthen your server security](https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Strong_SSL_Security_On_nginx.html). To achieve this we need to generate stronger DHE parameters.

```bash
openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 2048
```

#### Installation of the SSL Certificates

Out of the four files generated above, we need to install the `redmine.key`, `redmine.crt` and `dhparam.pem` files at the redmine server. The CSR file is not needed, but do make sure you safely backup the file (in case you ever need it again).

The default path that the redmine application is configured to look for the SSL certificates is at `/home/redmine/data/certs`, this can however be changed using the `SSL_KEY_PATH`, `SSL_CERTIFICATE_PATH` and `SSL_DHPARAM_PATH` configuration options.

If you remember from above, the `/home/redmine/data` path is the path of the [data store](#data-store), which means that we have to create a folder named certs inside `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/` and copy the files into it and as a measure of security we will update the permission on the `redmine.key` file to only be readable by the owner.

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/certs
cp redmine.key /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/certs/
cp redmine.crt /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/certs/
cp dhparam.pem /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/certs/
chmod 400 /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/certs/redmine.key
```

Great! we are now just one step away from having our application secured.

#### Enabling HTTPS support

HTTPS support can be enabled by setting the `REDMINE_HTTPS` option to `true`.

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -d \
  --env='REDMINE_HTTPS=true' \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

In this configuration, any requests made over the plain http protocol will automatically be redirected to use the https protocol. However, this is not optimal when using a load balancer.

#### Configuring HSTS

HSTS if supported by the browsers makes sure that your users will only reach your server via HTTPS. When the user comes for the first time it sees a header from the server which states for how long from now this site should only be reachable via HTTPS - that's the HSTS max-age value.

With `REDMINE_HTTPS_HSTS_MAXAGE` you can configure that value. The default value is `31536000` seconds. If you want to disable a already sent HSTS MAXAGE value, set it to `0`.

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -d \
  --env='REDMINE_HTTPS=true' \
  --env='REDMINE_HTTPS_HSTS_MAXAGE=2592000'
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

If you want to completely disable HSTS set `REDMINE_HTTPS_HSTS_ENABLED` to `false`.

#### Using HTTPS with a load balancer

Load balancers like nginx/haproxy/hipache talk to backend applications over plain http and as such the installation of ssl keys and certificates are not required and should **NOT** be installed in the container. The SSL configuration has to instead be done at the load balancer. Hoewever, when using a load balancer you **MUST** set `REDMINE_HTTPS` to `true`.

With this in place, you should configure the load balancer to support handling of https requests. But that is out of the scope of this document. Please refer to [Using SSL/HTTPS with HAProxy](http://seanmcgary.com/posts/using-sslhttps-with-haproxy) for information on the subject.

When using a load balancer, you probably want to make sure the load balancer performs the automatic http to https redirection. Information on this can also be found in the link above.

In summation, when using a load balancer, the docker command would look for the most part something like this:

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -d --publish=10083:80 \
  --env='REDMINE_HTTPS=true' \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

### Deploy to a subdirectory (relative url root)

By default redmine expects that your application is running at the root (eg. /). This section explains how to run your application inside a directory.

Let's assume we want to deploy our application to '/redmine'. Redmine needs to know this directory to generate the appropriate routes. This can be specified using the `REDMINE_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT` configuration option like so:

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -d --publish=10083:80 \
  --env='REDMINE_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT=/redmine' \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

Redmine will now be accessible at the `/redmine` path, e.g. `http://www.example.com/redmine`.

**Note**: *The `REDMINE_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT` parameter should always begin with a slash and **SHOULD NOT** have any trailing slashes.*

### Available Configuration Parameters

*Please refer the docker run command options for the `--env-file` flag where you can specify all required environment variables in a single file. This will save you from writing a potentially long docker run command.*

# Plugins

The functionality of redmine can be extended using plugins developed by the community. You can find a list of available plugins in the [Redmine Plugins Directory](http://www.redmine.org/plugins). You can also [search](https://github.com/search?type=Repositories&language=&q=redmine&repo=&langOverride=&x=0&y=0&start_value=1) for plugins on github.

*Please check the plugin compatibility with the redmine version before installing a plugin.*

## Installing Plugins

Plugins should be installed in the `plugins` directory at the [data store](#data-store). If you are following the readme verbatim, on the host this location would be `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins`.

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins
```

To install a plugin, simply copy the plugin assets to the `plugins` directory. For example, to install the [recurring tasks](https://github.com/nutso/redmine-plugin-recurring-tasks) plugin:

```bash
cd /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins
git clone https://github.com/nutso/redmine-plugin-recurring-tasks.git
```

For most plugins this is all you need to do. With the plugin installed you can start the docker image normally. The image will detect that a plugin has been added (or removed) and automatically install the required gems and perform the plugin migrations and will be ready for use.

***If the gem installation fails after adding a new plugin, please retry after removing the `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/tmp` directory***

Some plugins however, require you to perform additional configurations to function correctly. You can add these steps in a `init` script at the `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins` directory that will executed everytime the image is started.

For example, the recurring tasks plugin requires that you create a cron job to periodically execute a rake task. To achieve this, create the `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins/init` file with the following content:

```bash
## Recurring Tasks Configuration

# get the list existing cron jobs for the redmine user
crontab -u redmine -l 2>/dev/null >/tmp/cron.redmine

# add new job for recurring tasks if it does not exist
if ! grep -q redmine:recur_tasks /tmp/cron.redmine; then
  echo '@hourly cd /home/redmine/redmine && bundle exec rake redmine:recur_tasks RAILS_ENV=production >> log/cron_rake.log 2>&1' >>/tmp/cron.redmine
  crontab -u redmine /tmp/cron.redmine 2>/dev/null
fi

# remove the temporary file
rm -rf /tmp/cron.redmine

## End of Recurring Tasks Configuration
```

Now whenever the image is started the above init script will be executed and the required cron job will be installed.

Previously this image packaged a couple of plugins by default. Existing users would notice that those plugins are no longer available. If you want them back, follow these instructions:

```bash
cd /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins
wget http://goo.gl/iJcvCP -O - | sh
```

*Please Note: this [plugin install script](https://gist.github.com/sameersbn/dd24dfdd13bc472d11a5) is not maintained and you would need to fix it if required (especially broken links)*

## Uninstalling Plugins

To uninstall plugins you need to first tell redmine about the plugin you need to uninstall. This is done via a rake task:

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -it --rm \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1 \
  app:rake redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=plugin_name VERSION=0
```

Once the rake task has been executed, the plugin should be removed from the `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins/` directory.

```bash
rm -rf /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins/plugin_name
```

Any configuration that you may have added in the `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins/init` script for the plugin should also be removed.

For example, to remove the recurring tasks plugin:

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -it --rm \
  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1 \
  app:rake redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=recurring_tasks VERSION=0
rm -rf /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins/recurring_tasks
```

Now when the image is started the plugin will be gone.

# Themes

Just like plugins, redmine allows users to install additional themes. You can find a list of available themes in the [Redmine Themes Directory](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Theme_List)

## Installing Themes

Themes should be installed in the `themes` directory at the [data store](#data-store). If you are following the readme verbatim, on the host this location would be `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes`.

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes
```

To install a theme, simply copy the theme assets to the `themes` directory. For example, to install the [gitmike](https://github.com/makotokw/redmine-theme-gitmike) theme:

```bash
cd /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes
git clone https://github.com/makotokw/redmine-theme-gitmike.git gitmike
```

With the theme installed you can start the docker image normally and the newly installed theme should be available for use.

Previously this image packaged a couple of themes by default. Existing users would notice that those themes are no longer available. If you want them back, follow these instructions:

```bash
cd /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes
wget http://goo.gl/deKDpp -O - | sh
```

*Please Note: this [theme install script](https://gist.github.com/sameersbn/aaa1b7bb064703c1e23c) is not maintained and you would need to fix it if required (especially broken links)*

## Uninstalling Themes

To uninstall plugins you simply need to remove the theme from the `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes/` directory and restart the image.

```bash
rm -rf /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes/theme_name
```

For example, to remove the gitmike theme:

```bash
rm -rf /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes/gitmike
```

Now when the image is started the theme will be not be available anymore.

# Database Backup

To perform a dump from the docker-based database run (docker>=1.3.0):
```bash
docker exec -it redmine /app/backup/run.sh
```

This creates a dump in /home/redmine/data/dbbackup/ that is mapped to some location on the docker host

You may want to include this script and related log compression & cleanup in your regular schedule.

How to restore, just in case:
```bash
# create fresh database container
docker rm postgresql-redmine
docker run [.. your options fo here ..] sameersbn/postgresql:9.4
# create empty database (needs privileges in the postgres container)
docker exec -it postgresql-redmine /bin/bash
su - postgres
psql
DROP DATABASE redmine_production;
CREATE DATABASE redmine_production;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE redmine_production to redmine;
\q
exit
# load schema and data from backup
docker exec -it redmine /bin/bash
cd /home/redmine/data/dbbackup/
psql -h postgresql -U redmine redmine_production < insertnameofdump.sql
exit
```

# Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell. If you are using docker version `1.3.0` or higher you can access a running containers shell using `docker exec` command.

```bash
docker exec -it redmine bash
```

If you are using an older version of docker, you can use the [nsenter](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nsenter.1.html) linux tool (part of the util-linux package) to access the container shell.

Some linux distros (e.g. ubuntu) use older versions of the util-linux which do not include the `nsenter` tool. To get around this @jpetazzo has created a nice docker image that allows you to install the `nsenter` utility and a helper script named `docker-enter` on these distros.

To install `nsenter` execute the following command on your host,

```bash
docker run --rm --volume=/usr/local/bin:/target jpetazzo/nsenter
```

Now you can access the container shell using the command

```bash
sudo docker-enter redmine
```

For more information refer https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter

# Upgrading

To upgrade to newer redmine releases, simply follow this 4 step upgrade procedure.

**Step 1**: Update the docker image.

```bash
docker pull sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

**Step 2**: Stop and remove the currently running image

```bash
docker stop redmine
docker rm redmine
```

**Step 3**: Backup the database in case something goes wrong.

```bash
mysqldump -h <mysql-server-ip> -uredmine -p --add-drop-table redmine_production > redmine.sql
```

**Step 4**: Start the image

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -d [OPTIONS] sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1
```

## Rake Tasks

The `app:rake` command allows you to run redmine rake tasks. To run a rake task simply specify the task to be executed to the `app:rake` command. For example, if you want to send a test email to the admin user.

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -d [OPTIONS] \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1 app:rake redmine:email:test[admin]
```

You can also use `docker exec` to run rake tasks on running redmine instance. For example,

```bash
docker exec -it redmine sudo -u redmine -H bundle exec rake redmine:email:test[admin] RAILS_ENV=production
```

Similarly, to remove uploaded files left unattached

```bash
docker run --name=redmine -d [OPTIONS] \
  sameersbn/redmine:3.0.3-1 app:rake redmine:attachments:prune
```

Or,

```bash
docker exec -it redmine sudo -u redmine -H bundle exec rake redmine:attachments:prune RAILS_ENV=production
```

For a complete list of available rake tasks please refer www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineRake.
