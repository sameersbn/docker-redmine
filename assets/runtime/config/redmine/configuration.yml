# Each environment has it's own configuration options.  If you are only
# running in production, only the production block needs to be configured.
# Environment specific configuration options override the default ones.

# Note that this file needs to be a valid YAML file.
# DO NOT USE TABS! Use 2 spaces instead of tabs for identation.

  # Absolute path to the directory where attachments are stored.
  # The default is the 'files' directory in your Redmine instance.
  # Your Redmine instance needs to have write permission on this

  # SCM paths validation.
  #
  # You can configure a regular expression for each SCM that will be used to
  # validate the path of new repositories (eg. path entered by users with the
  # "Manage repositories" permission and path returned by reposman.rb).
  # The regexp will be wrapped with \A \z, so it must match the whole path.
  # And the regexp is case sensitive.
  #
  # You can match the project identifier by using %project% in the regexp.
  #
  # You can also set a custom hint message for each SCM that will be displayed
  # on the repository form instead of the default one.
  #
  # Examples:
  # scm_subversion_path_regexp: file:///svnpath/[a-z0-9_]+
  # scm_subversion_path_info: SVN URL (eg. file:///svnpath/foo)
  #
  # scm_git_path_regexp: /gitpath/%project%(\.[a-z0-9_])?/
  #

  # The default is to log in the 'log' directory of your Redmine instance.

  # If you have encrypted data and want to change this key, you have to:
